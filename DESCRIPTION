Description: 
    `{tweetio}` has three goals: 1) efficiently read Twitter data into R from multiple 
    sources, 2) provide the building blocks for robust analytical pipelines that use 
    network, spatial, and/or natural language processing perspectives, and 3) write Twitter
    data to multiple file formats, including those that best enable non-technical analysts 
    to work. The primary data structure is inspired by `{rtweet}`, and 
    all analytical routines being compatible with `{rtweet}` data frames is heavily
    prioritized.
